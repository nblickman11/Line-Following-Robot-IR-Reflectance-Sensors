The "test_motor_pkg" contains all code of the line following robot.  The demo video is for this code.

Next, the "algorithm improvements" contains ROS nodes that implement the PID Control algorithm. This smoothed it but slow so not including video.

# Line-Following-Robot-IR-Reflectance-Sensors

#### Summary: 
I built a ROS 2-based autonomous line-following robot from scratch using a Raspberry Pi. The robot performs real-time computer vision using an onboard camera, computes steering commands with centroid-based proportional control, and controls a differential-drive platform through a modular ROS 2 software architecture.

#### Software Used:   
ROS 2 – Robotics middleware for inter-node communication.  
Ubuntu – Linux operating system running on the Raspberry Pi.  
OpenCV – Image processing and computer vision.  
GStreamer – Camera streaming framework.  
C++ – Core robotics software implementation.  
GPIO Library – Controls the L298N motor driver via Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.  

#### Algorithm and Implementation:

The robot uses a modular ROS 2 perception and control pipeline to convert camera images into real-time steering commands.

###### Camera Capture
- Captures 640×480 RGB images from the Raspberry Pi Camera using a GStreamer pipeline.
- Converts image frames into ROS 2 image messages using OpenCV and `cv_bridge`.
- Publishes synchronized `Image` and `CameraInfo` messages.

###### Image Processing
- Converts RGB images to grayscale.
- Applies binary thresholding to isolate the white line from the background.
- Publishes the thresholded image for downstream processing.

###### Line Detection
- Computes the centroid of the detected line using OpenCV image moments.
- Calculates steering error as the horizontal distance between the line centroid and the center of the image.
- Processes every third image frame to reduce computation and improve controller responsiveness.

###### Proportional Steering Control
- Uses a proportional (P) controller to convert centroid error into an angular steering command.
- Publishes linear and angular velocity commands (`/cmd_vel`) for robot navigation.

###### Differential Drive Motor Control
- Converts velocity commands into GPIO signals for the L298N motor driver.
- Controls the left and right motors independently to drive forward, turn, and perform smooth curved steering.
- Applies steering thresholds and pulsed motor commands to reduce oscillation and improve tracking performance.

#### Improvements:

- Improved overall lap time by repositioning the camera and increasing the camera frame rate in the Camera Driver node, allowing the robot to detect upcoming turns earlier.
- Reduced the number of image frames processed downstream in the ROS 2 pipeline, allowing the motor controller to keep pace with incoming sensor data and reducing control latency.
- Tuned the proportional steering controller by increasing the steering threshold. Small centroid errors were ignored, reducing unnecessary steering corrections, minimizing oscillation, and allowing the robot to maintain higher speeds.
- Increased the image region used for line detection, enabling the robot to look farther ahead on the track. This reduced overshooting during turns and produced smoother, more stable navigation.
